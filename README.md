## Task

The task is to use recurrent neural networks to build a transliteration system

## Submission

My WandB project:
My WandB report:

## Dataset

The dataset is a sample of the [Aksharantar dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tGIO4-IPNtxJ6RQMmykvAfY_B0AaLY5A/view?usp=drive_link) released by AI4Bharat. This dataset contains pairs of words in the native script and its corresponding transliteration in the Latin script.

## Implementation Details

In this section, we delve into the implementation of the transliteration system, detailing the structure and functionalities of each component.

## Tools and Libraries Used

The implementation of the project utilizes the following tools and libraries:

- **Python 3.10.1**: The core programming language used for implementing all aspects of the project.

- **WandB (Weights and Biases)**: WandB is utilized for running experiments, hyperparameter tuning, visualization, and more.

- **Pytorch 2.0.0**: Pytorch framework is used to implement the RNN Encoder and Decoder network.

- **Pandas 1.5.3**: Pandas library is used to read the data from the .csv dataset files.

### Installation

All the above packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, simply execute the following command:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

By installing the listed packages, you can ensure that all necessary dependencies are met for running the project smoothly.

## Usage
